# COSMIC STORAGE #

By using this project you can avail infinite storage ðŸ˜±

### HOW? ###
Currently there is no limit on how many videos you can upload on youtube, there is a limit on the size of each video, but it's not our concern for now

Sample YouTube Video

### HOW IT WORKS ###
1. As we know we can upload only videos on youtube, say yes ðŸ˜‚
2. And we also know at the end every file is of the form 1 and 0
3. So first of all I convert the file in the form of 1's and 0's 
4. Append the 1 as a white pixel and 0 as a black pixel in am image, and combine all the images to form a video
5. ya upload the video generated on YouTube 

### HOW TO USE ###
1. Upload your file in input folder
2. run main.py in FILE TO BINARY
3. Video will be added to the video folder
4. now upload the video to YouTube 
5. So I used SAVE FROM NET to download videos from youtube in 720p 
6. add the downloaded video to the video folder and run main.py in VIDEO TO FILE

### THINGS TO REMEMBER ###
1. make sure your file type is added in utils.py
