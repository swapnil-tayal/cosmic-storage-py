### HOW? ###
Currenlty there is no limit on how much videos you can upload on youtube, there is limit on size of each video, but it's not our concern for now

Sample YouTube Video

### HOW IT WORKS ###
1. As we know we can upload only videos on youtube, say yes ðŸ˜‚
2. And we also also know at the end each and every file is of the form 1 and 0
3. So first of all I convert the file in form of 1's and 0's 
4. Append the 1 as a white pixel and 0 as black pixel in am image, combine all the images to form video
5. And ya upload the video generated on youtube 

### HOW TO USE ###
1. Upload your file in input folder
2. run main.py in FILE TO BINARY
3. Video will be added to video folder
4. now upload the video to youtube 
5. So I personally used SAVE FROM NET to download video from youtube in 720p 
6. add the downloaded video in video folder and run main.py in VIDEO TO FILE

### THINGS TO REMEMBER ###
1. make sure your file type is added in utils.py
